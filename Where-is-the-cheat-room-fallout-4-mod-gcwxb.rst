 · Fallout 4 suffers from an immense lack of replay-ability for several reasons and The Cheat Bunker is here to help augment your subsequent experiences. Eventually, we all use mods that are implicitly.  · Changed Portable Storage Pipboy Close Method to default to Method 1. Refactored the Cheat Terminal to be placed by a quest, so the mod no longer holds SanctuaryExt hostage. Added Configuration -> Cheat Terminal, to allow the user to disable the Cheat Terminal in Sanctuary, if they don't like it. The cheat room is a mod for the PS4 and you can find it also on the the Xbox and PC. it is a mod where you can get all the items in the game. If you type "COC QASMOKE" without the quotes in Fallout 4's console commands, you will be teleported into a secret room.
