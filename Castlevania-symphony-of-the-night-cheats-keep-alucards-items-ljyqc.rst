 · Play as Other Characters and Extras. You must complete the game as Alucard with % or more and have a "CLEAR" Save. Alucard with Axelord armor. Enter AXEARMOR as your name. Alucard with lower stats and MAX Luck. Enter X-X!V''Q as your name. Play as Richter Belmont. Enter RICHTER as your name.  · Just me doing the glitch for Castlevania SOTN where you don't lose all of Alucard's stuff at the beginning of the game. Everybody should know of this glitch.  · Keep the Alucard Sword, Alucard Shield, etc. To keep your default inventory instead of losing the gear to Death, proceed right until you reach the room just before Death for the first time. Kill 93%(12).
