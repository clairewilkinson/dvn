Like all software, games in particular, Merge Dragons! has bugs that must be squished. The purpose of this page is to provide players visibility into known bugs, and their priority. If you found a bug, please consider adding it to this page and report it directly to the support. For more up to date information you can visit official Discord channel or Merge Dragons subreddit. You cannot unlock clouded land under glitch. Merging is allowed, albeit laggy. When merging, Dimension Jars will still randomly spawn. You can use gems on them but they will not break, effectively making you waste your gems. In shop, all gem prices stay the same. Buying a shit ton of event eggs will keep the price at 10 gems. Hey, no matter what year it is, but Merge Dragons hack still works! When we initially found the glitch, we thought if might be fixed soon. But looks like that didn't happen, and that might mean that the creators of the game are actually happy with the way it works for players.
