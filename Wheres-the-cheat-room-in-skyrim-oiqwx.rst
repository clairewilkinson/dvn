[Question] Skyrim Cheat room for PC? As the tittle says, I tried to get that mod for PC but I only saw Nintendo switch or Xbox One options, I'm interested only in the level up of talents/perks/charLevel I think that could be done with commands but I remember that u didn't get the exp for that or something like that, so cheat room seems more. Running Cathedral Weather, LUX and Rudy Cathedral Zangar performance version. Just get rid of the LUT color change VR Vision made as it messes up Rudy's professionally calibrated colors. 1) VRVision  - removed LUT@ from these two lines, you may like it so feel free to keep.  · For The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition on the Xbox One, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Where exactly in the cheat room can I find Nocturnals robes?"%(24).
