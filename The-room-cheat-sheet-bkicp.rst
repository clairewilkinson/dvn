Reply ↓.  · Zoom Room Cheat Sheets. PM. Hello all! We are transitioning back to the office and implementing Zoom Rooms. I was curious to know if anyone has any cheat sheets we could display within the room so that end-users know how to use Zoom Rooms. I've tried the actual Zoom Room support guides but I wanted some more of a one-page guide. The Room includes four chapters where you must find clues and solve puzzles in order to reach the next level. It is a real brain-teaser with excellently realistic 3D graphics that will keep you hooked until you beat the app. This The Room Walkthrough provides answers, cheats and solutions, to all chapters of The Room if you get stuck on a level.
