 · The trick is when you go through the ladders, is for the goat to be at the bottom when you are between the ladders. I would also suggest you download the fullscreen Flappy Goat workshop item because it allows you to see it much more clearly. Also use slow motion mode (F), it doesn't slow down the game but in your mind it kind of does. Get the latest cheats, codes, unlockables, hints, Easter eggs, glitches, tips, tricks, hacks, downloads, trophies, guides, FAQs, and walkthroughs for Goat Simulator. Go to the sacrificial circle (corner of the map) once you have become the Goat Queen and spawn 4 goats in the circle by pressing the 'Special Action' button. You then need to find a human, lick them, and take them back to the the circle. Now with 5 items in the circle the ritual will begin and you will change into the Devil Goat. Comments 17 0.
